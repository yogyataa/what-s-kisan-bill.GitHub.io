  is heralding the path for farmers to be atmanirbhar.<br>

<h3>If you read the poem then you must be having a simple question which is raised by the <br>
 poet that who is this "Third man"?   </h3>
     
   <h4>POEM IN ENGLISH <br>
     <p>  A Man Makes bread <br>
A man eats bread<br>
There is also a third man<br>
He who does not eat bread nor does he eat bread<br>
He plays only with bread<br>
I ask 'Who is this third man?'<br>
 Why My country's parliament is silent <br>

<h5> WHAT IS THERE IN KISAN BILL OR IN THE FARMERS' PRODUCE TRADE AND COMMERCE BILL ?</h5>
<h6> There is written <br>
  <p>   A <br> <br> Bill <br> <br> to provide for the creation of an ecosystem
     where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of 
     choices relating to sale and purchase of farmers'  
     produce which facilitates remunerative prices through 
     competitive alternative trading channels; to promote 
     efficient, transparent and barrier-free inter-State and
     intra-State trade and commerce of farmers’ produce outside
     the physical premises of markets or deemed markets notified 
     under various State agricultural produce market legislations; 
     to provide a facilitative framework for electronic trading 
     and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
     The two main points or keywords of this act are <br></p>
      CHAPTER 1 <br>

     	 
       <li>inter-state trade</li>
    <li>intra-state trade </li></h6>
     	<h5> WHAT IS INTER STATE TRADE ?</h5>
     	<h6> <p>  “inter-State trade” means the act of buying or selling of farmers’ produce,
wherein a trader of one State buys the farmers’produce from the farmer or a trader of
another State and such farmers’ produce is transported to a State other than the State
in which the trader purchased such farmers’ produce or where such farmers’ produce
originated; If Simplify the concept of inter-State trade or commerce, it is the physical movement of goods from one State to another, or from one Union Territory to another, or from a State to a Union Territory or vice versa</p></h6>
</h6></p>
<h5> WHAT IS INTRA STATE TRADE ? </h5>
<h6><p> “intra-State trade” means the act of buying or selling of farmers’ produce,
wherein a trader of one State buys the farmers’ produce from a farmer or a trader of the
same State in which the trader purchased such farmers’ produce or where such farmers’
produce originated; </p></h6>
 <h3> CHAPTER 2</h3>
 <h6> PROMOTION AND FACILITATION OF TRADE AND COMMERCE OF FARMERS’ PRODUCE<br>
3. Subject to the provisions of this Act, any farmer or trader or electronic trading and
transaction platform shall have the freedom to carry on the inter-State or intra-State trade and
commerce in farmers’ produce in a trade area.<br><br>
4. (1) Any trader may engage in the inter-State trade or intra-State trade of scheduled
farmers’ produce with a farmer or another trader in a trade area:
Provided that no trader, except the farmer producer organisations or agricultural
cooperative society, shall trade in any scheduled farmers’ produce unless such a trader has
a permanent account number allotted under the Income-tax Act, 1961 or such other document
as may be notified by the Central Government.<br><br>
(2) The Central Government may, if it is of the opinion that it is necessary and expedient
in the public interest so to do, prescribe a system for electronic registration for a trader,
modalities of trade transaction and mode of payment of the scheduled farmers’ produce in a
trade area. <br> <br>
Once the first legislation is enacted, farmers will be freed from the grip of the middleman, and able to sell their produce to buyers from across the country at a price they deem to be fair and at a time of their choosing. Freedom to sell at the farm gate will do away with transportation expenses, and thus boost incomes. This is a giant stride towards the fulfilment of the dream of ‘One Nation, One Market’ 73 years after Independence.

<h3>ARGUMENTS FOR THE FARMERS’ PRODUCE TRADE AND COMMERCE (PROMOTION
AND FACILITATION) BILL, 2020

<h6> 1. According to the government rules & regulations, this Bill would increase the income of a farmer in the agriculture sector.<br><br>

 2. This Bill doubles the income of Farmer’s by the year 2022; along with this, the Kendriya Government has made sure that Farmer would become independent from all government under controlled marketers. They will decide on their crop price.<br><br>

 3. The government has made sure that Bills started to make a system for all farmers as well as traders to sell their crops outside Mandis. <br><br>

 4. It also strengthens intra-state trade, and this tends to decrease the price of transportation.<br><br>

 5. This new Farm Bill’s main aim is to enable all Farmer’s to enlist with several retailers, exporters, agri-business for the sale and service of crops.<br><br>

 6. The main government aim from this Bill is to take advantage of all marginal as well as small scale farmers with only very low or low than five hectares of land.<br><br>

<h3>ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE FARMERS’ PRODUCE TRADE AND COMMERCE (PROMOTION
AND FACILITATION) BILL, 2020 </h3><br><br>

<h6>
1. According to the Farmer’s, they are afraid of crop Minimum Support Price [MSP], and along with this, they worried towards the hand of all agri-business & big retailers. <br><br>
